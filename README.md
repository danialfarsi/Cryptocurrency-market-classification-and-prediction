## Problem 3: Prediction

- Focused on predicting Monero's closing price increase or decrease for the next day.
- Utilized yfinance library for cryptocurrency data extraction.
- Allowed use of machine learning algorithms taught in bootcamp classes.
- Emphasized target variable labeling based on final price comparison.
- Suggested potential features for dataset, ensuring no target variable leakage.

The project aimed to enhance understanding of clustering algorithms, hierarchical clustering, and predictive modeling in the context of cryptocurrency data, while encouraging creative problem-solving and exploration of diverse features for improved predictions.
